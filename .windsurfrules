### General Guidelines

Always write reusable code to improve maintainability and efficiency.
Always check for existing dependencies before adding new ones to avoid conflicts and redundancy.
Always avoid duplicate code by using functions, classes, and reusable components.
Always update the README.md file to keep project documentation up to date.
Always store strings in strings.xml instead of hardcoding them unless absolutely necessary.
Always use #styles.xml for Day/Night mode and consistent theming across the app.
Always optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary loops, heavy computations on the main thread, and excessive memory usage.
Always handle exceptions properly to prevent crashes and improve app stability.
Always check for existing UI components before creating new ones to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy.
Always properly integrate new screens into the existing UI structure to maintain a smooth user experience.
Always design responsive layouts to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations for better accessibility and usability.
